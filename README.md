# Repository Structure

## Overview
This repository contains two main directories: `issue` and `repo`, organizing GitHub data based on time periods and filtering stages.

## Directory Structure

### 📁 repo/

#### 📂 all/
- Top 100 starred repositories
- Includes `top_20/` subdirectory with repositories selected based on:
  - Active "help wanted" and "question" issue tags
  - Priority given to repositories with higher issue counts when scores are tied

#### 📂 recent/
- Top 1000 starred repositories created after July 2nd, 2024
- Includes `top_20/` subdirectory with similar selection criteria as `all/`

### 📁 issue/
Contains processed GitHub issues with various filtering stages.

#### Common Structure for both `all/` and `recent/`:
