    "body": "### Related to an existing integration?\n\nYes\n\n### Existing integration\n\nOllama\n\n### Overview\n\nIn the Ollama integration there is an additional builder enabling the OpenWebUI container image. Right now it is bound to a specific integrations' image tag.  The space is moving fast and Ollama and OpenWebUI are moving along fast with it. While the Ollama container image is flexible the OpenWebUI one is not.\n\nIt would be great to add a flexibility to provide the image tag as an override.\n\n### Usage example\n\ncurrent:\n\n```csharp\nvar ollama = builder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n    .WithDataVolume()\n    .WithOpenWebUI(); //gets whatever image is in the resource now eg 0.4.8\n```\n\nproposed would enable:\n```csharp\nvar ollama = builder.AddOllama(\"ollama\")\n    .WithDataVolume()\n    .WithOpenWebUI(imageTag: \"0.5.7\");\n```\n\n### Breaking change?\n\nNo\n\n### Alternatives\n\nmanually use AddContainer and re-specify all the defaults for the container, and establish connection with the Ollama resource.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Help us help you\n\nNo, just wanted to propose this",
