SPIRV-Cross depends on threads, which means that MinGW builds introduce a dependency on libwinpthreads. This is unfortunate. I'm not sure that we can wiggle out of this.\n\n---\n\nI think we should probably remove the MinGW build from CI, I don't think there's any point since it has a hard dependency on MinGW libs."
