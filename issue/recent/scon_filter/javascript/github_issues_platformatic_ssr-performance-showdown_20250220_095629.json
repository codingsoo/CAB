    "body": "This PR implements what I refer to in #16. While it leaves Solid basically holding the bag on serialization due to our hydration mechanism I think it is fair. We also are the only hydration implementation that doesn't use id keyed lists (but they are keyed) but that's part of the tradeoff. \r\n\r\nThe end result is at least locally fastify-html takes the crown again as I'd expect it to. Although I imagine hydratable frameworks with hydration disabled should give it a run for its money.",
