Do you have this problem with one particular wallpaper or it's common with others too?\r\nCan you send me wallpaper to play with, so I can adjust colors a little if it's needed?\r\n\r\nAlso next release will contain new cmd line argument ``--bright-offset``, so you can adjust brightness without losing color palette "
