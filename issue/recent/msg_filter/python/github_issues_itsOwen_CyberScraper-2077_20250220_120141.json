    "body": "Hey everyone, just needed a little clarity on the usage with ollama. I was trying to use local model using ollama (llama3.1 8b) but on querying about the website it always throws the error \"An unexpected error occurred: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /encodings/o200k_base.tiktoken (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7f9628608f20>: Failed to establish a new connection: Error connecting to SOCKS5 proxy 127.0.0.1:9050: [Errno 111] Connection refused')). Please try again or contact support if the issue persists.\". Observing the logs , i see that my GPU keeps crashing. I have a RTX 2060S with 8 GB Vram. Was wondering what is the min requirement of Vram to run this locally, also is there a way to run this using Groq??Any help would be appreciated.",
