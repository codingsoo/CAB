I've been building a small sample to play around with Clay in C++ using Zig as the build system and I kept running into a weird error that was driving me crazy for awhile. \r\n\r\nWith Zig, fetching dependencies is fairly trivial, just tell it to fetch a link and then point it at the right files and you are good to go. Apparently because of a header inside of the C++ stdlib `#include <version>` and the `VERSION` file at the root of this repository, a compilation conflict was happening in my include paths (namely including the root of this repo to ensure `clay.h` is in my path). Was wondering if in the GitHub releases you could also have one with the header nested inside of an `include/` directory or something to side step this? I could see it being an issue in CMake as well.\r\n\r\nEither way, the framework seems super cool, and excited to keep working with it!",
