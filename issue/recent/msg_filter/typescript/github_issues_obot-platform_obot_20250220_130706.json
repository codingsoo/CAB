Refreshing gets the new data.\n\noptions here are to either make the response synchronous or implement Polling in the UI. ~~If we were to go with Polling, I'd probably want some indicator as to when the tool was last updated so I know when to stop polling for the updates~~\n\nEdit: I tried using `revision` as an indicator, but that did not help because there will be times where `Force Refresh` is triggered and there will be no changes to the repo. In this scenario, polling would start but never stop (unless with an arbitrary timeout)\n\nWith this in mind polling is not a good solution and I'd push to make the api synchronous. Very open to discussion on the matter though.\n\nWDYT?"

I believe polling is already implemented for tool references in the UI because I added a `resolved` field to the tool reference object that is false or undefined until the tool reference has been updated. That field should still be useful in this case."
