    "body": "Occasionally, when using Snapkey in CS2, a key will 'stick' and stay depressed when it is physically not being pressed in that instance of time. \r\n\r\nHere's what I know. \r\n-From my experience, it appears that a key may stick when using the inputs (SHFT+A), and in one instance where it was (SHFT+A,S). Occurs when I walk backward in CS. \r\n-Unsticking the key is done by releasing all keys and selecting the opposite key, and snapkey is back to normal. \r\n\r\nI will attempt to replicate it and report back. \r\n",
