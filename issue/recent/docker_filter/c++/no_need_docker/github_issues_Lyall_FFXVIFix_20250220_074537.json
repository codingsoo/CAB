    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI installed the files in the game folder and when I started up the game it is still locked to 16:9. In game resolution is set to 3440x1440\r\nand windowing is set to fullscreen. I kept the ini file the same so the x,y res values are 0. This is the demo version if that makes a difference.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
