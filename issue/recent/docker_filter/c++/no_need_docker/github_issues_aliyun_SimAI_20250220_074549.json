I don't quite understand the reasoning behind this configuration. Could you provide an example of a similar public topology? (Are you trying to set up a switch with dual uplinks?)\r\n2. Can you simulate your desired scenario by increasing the bandwidth of a specific port?\r\n3. Actually, you can specify multiple links, but that would require modifying the code on the ns3 side. You would need to consider the routing policies in such a scenario."
