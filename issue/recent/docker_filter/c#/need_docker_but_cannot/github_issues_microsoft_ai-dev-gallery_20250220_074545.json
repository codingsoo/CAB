Narrator: \"Content has finished generating\" \n5. We automatically focus the text block\n6. At this point the user should enter scan mode to have the Narrator read the text\n\nAutomatically having Narrator read the text creates a situation where we can't stop the text from being read out. Users have complete control of this in scan mode."
