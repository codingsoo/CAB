Is it safe to input them on the character.json file under \"secrets\", or is it better to have them in the .env?\r\n\r\n What if you are running more than one character? Is there a way to add 2 different login info for the same platform (e.g twitter, or discord) in the .env and have them be assigned to different characters.json?",
