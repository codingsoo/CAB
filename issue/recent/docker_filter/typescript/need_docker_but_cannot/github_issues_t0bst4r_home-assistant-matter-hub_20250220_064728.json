    "body": "Awesome project, i just installed it and i'm pretty happy with it.\r\n\r\nHowever i have the problem that the names of devices will be changed back to the names assigned in home assistant. For example i have a smart plug called \"living room TV\" in home assistant that i want to name just \"TV\" in alexa. However, if i restart the bridge, the name is \"living room TV\" after that and the group i assigned in the alexa app is gone. On Homekit this is no issue, the names and rooms persist after a restart of HAMH. \r\nIs there a way to fix this?",
