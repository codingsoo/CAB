    "body": "**Description**\n\nWhen attempting to start recording with an invalid filename using the `recorder.startRecording` method, a `RecorderFailedToInitializeRecordingException` is thrown. The error message does not provide sufficient information about the cause of the issue.\n\n**Steps To Reproduce**\n\n1. Include two colons (:) in the filename.\n2. Pass the file path to the `recorder.startRecording` method.\n\n**Example Code**\n\nDart\n```\nfinal DateTime now = DateTime.now();\nfinal DateFormat formatter = DateFormat('MMdd_HH:mm:ss');\nfinal String timestamp = formatter.format(now);\n\nString path = p.join(\n  r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\Documents\\Projects\\voicebot_flutter\\app\\voicebot\\a_recording\",\n  'my_file_$timestamp.wav',\n);\n\nrecorder.startRecording(completeFilePath: path);\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nThe `recorder.startRecording` method should throw an exception with a clear error message indicating that the filename is invalid.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nA `RecorderFailedToInitializeRecordingException: The recording failed to start (on the C++ side).` is thrown with a generic error message that does not provide information about the invalid filename.\n",
