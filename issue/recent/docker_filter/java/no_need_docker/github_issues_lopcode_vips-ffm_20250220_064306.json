    "body": "Going by the code of Vips.init() and Vips.shutdown(), I would assume to only call both once per application and not once per thread. The library would then be usable from all threads, without any kind of synchronization needed, as long as someone doesn't share VImage objects or the like across threads.\r\n\r\nOr do I need to always call Vips.init() and Vips.shutdown() in every thread where vips-ffm is used? \r\n\r\nThanks!",
