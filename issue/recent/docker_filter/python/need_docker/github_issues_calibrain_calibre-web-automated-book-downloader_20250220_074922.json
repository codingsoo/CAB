Tried using the ENV variables, that didn't work (still used 8084 and 8000), tried remapping ports directly and that seemed to work but couldn't connect to the Cloudflare proxy w/localhost or got errors using an IP instead (connection refused).  \r\n\r\nGuessing I'm just doing something incorrect, but would see shifting ports as a pretty big need for many.",
