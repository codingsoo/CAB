    "body": "`similarity_percentile` was not working with spdm chunker because the `similarity_threshold` was not computed. I have added test to reproduce the same.\r\n\r\n**Fix**\r\nI moved the computation `similarity_threshold` into `_prepare_sentences`. This decouples the computation of `similarity_threshold` with other steps.",
