    "body": "I know designing for mobile is probably a huge can of worms.  But there are times when using my phone is more convenient, and when I try to use it I can initiate a search which is great.  But the results are usually unusable, since I cannot fully pan over to the right where the buttons are.  If even that one piece could somehow be fixed when using the mobile, being able to click detail/download or fully read the results, that would be great.",
