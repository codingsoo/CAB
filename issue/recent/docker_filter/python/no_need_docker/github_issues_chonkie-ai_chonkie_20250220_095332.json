Before that, it was `__slots__` for versions 3.8 and 3.9, which needs to be added in the codebase.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it got missed as an error. As a workaround for now, could you try it with Python 3.10? \r\n\r\nI'll add a backward compatible version of slots into Chonkie in a patch release as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks! "
