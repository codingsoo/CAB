This means if I cold start my app and immediately open the browser, I get an empty white page.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a way to figure out when the initial compilation is done so only then we can open the browser for better DX. Does something like this in form of a hook already exist?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWebpack only changing to a ready state once the webapp can be visited\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nBetter developer experience\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nFor example using a hook, or changing when when Webpack calls the 'done' hook. The PR #12553 which could disable lazy importing for certain files also looks promising, because then maybe I could disable it for my entry files.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nno\r\n",

I haven't gotten to the point yet of testing the bundle on a page and had assumed that the order in which the modules appeared in output was the order they would be executed (aka a pure concat). WRONG. I didn't realize an array of module functions was being passed to the bootstrapper. This is commonjs for front end. Nothing is run until you require a module. All require.context was doing was setting up the modules. So yes, the order of modules passed to the bootstrapper doesn't matter. The order in which you require those modules does, hence your example of re-ordering the keys based on directory depth and then executing them in that new order.\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer my question.\n"

Imagine you had a jQuery plugin, that you only wanted to load in certain situations, then you would use this. Here is a bit of code that I use to autoload Highlight.JS only when code blocks are there. This allows me to keep the main script\u2019s filesize low, but load additional code on-demand.\n\n```\nif($(\"body\").find(\"pre code\").length > 0) {\n    require.ensure([\n        // Should only load the hljs stuff we need...\n        \"highlight.js\",\n        // Stylesheet.\n        \"highlight.js/styles/hybrid.css\"\n    ], function(hljs){\n        hljs.configure({\n            tabReplace: Array(5).join(\" \")\n        });\n        $(\"body\").find(\"pre code\").each(function(i,v){\n            if($(v).prop(\"class\").match(/language-.+/ig) != null) {\n                // The current block has a language- class.\n                $(v).addClass(\"hascode\");\n                $(v).parent().addClass(\"hascode\");\n                hljs.highlightBlock(v);\n            }\n        });\n    });\n}\n```\n\nwhenever you use require.ensure, that module is put into a separate chunk (aka. another file) which is added to the page once the call occurs. That is also why you have to supply a callback. It will only then be called when the async loading is done and the module is ready to be used.\n\nOn Sa.
