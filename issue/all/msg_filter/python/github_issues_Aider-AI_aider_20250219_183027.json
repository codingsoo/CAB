It has changed my view of LLM's and made me appreciate them so much more!\r\n\r\nI'd like to use aider from a folder other than my git repo.  `git` itself has an option for this: `-C`.  Does aider have any support for this.\r\n\r\nMy use case is that I'm using direnv from a directory that is not the root of my git repo.  I want to use aider from this dir, too.  I can't just put direnv at the root of my repo because I have multiple different configurations I use for various tasks with this repo.\r\n\r\nWith other tools, there is an environmental variable I can use.  For example, PIPENV_PIPFILE for pipenv and PYTHONPATH.  \n\n### Version and model info\n\nLatest version of aider",

    "body": "### Issue\r\n\r\n#### Problem:\r\n\r\nWhen working with large codebases, especially in a multi-directory setup, `aider` often suggests adding files from various locations in the workspace that aren\u2019t relevant to the task at hand. For example, when troubleshooting a `requirements.txt` issue in the root directory, `aider` might repeatedly prompt the user to add similarly named files from different subdirectories (e.g., `tests/localstack/example/requirements.txt`), which can be frustrating.\r\n\r\nExample of the issue:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nAdd pulumi_lib/tests/localstack/example/requirements.txt to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o\r\n [Yes]: n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prompt appears multiple times, despite the user already specifying not to add it. Constantly declining these prompts interrupts the flow of work.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Solution:\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new in-chat command, `/block` or `/block-add`, which allows the user to block specific files or file patterns from being suggested for addition in the future. This block should:\r\n- Work with file names and patterns (supporting regex).\r\n- Only affect files that haven\u2019t been added yet (won\u2019t remove files that are already part of the session).\r\n- Allow for easy unblocking through either the `/drop` command or a new `/drop-block` command.\r\n\r\n#### Command Usage:\r\n\r\nEither of the following could be a good way to implement the command usage or perhaps something different.\r\n\r\n- **/block [file_path_or_pattern]**: Blocks files matching the specified name or pattern from being suggested for addition.\r\n- **/drop-block [file_path_or_pattern]**: Unblocks files matching the specified pattern, allowing them to be suggested for addition again.\r\n  \r\nBy incorporating regex support, this allows users to easily block entire sets of files that follow a particular pattern (e.g., all `tests/requirements.txt` files).\r\n\r\n### Extended Feature Proposal: `/block-cmd` Command to Prevent Repeated Command Suggestions\r\n\r\n#### Problem:\r\n\r\nIn addition to unwanted file addition prompts, `aider` can also suggest commands that may not be relevant or useful for the current context. Repeatedly declining these suggestions can disrupt the user's workflow.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `aider` frequently suggests commands that you don\u2019t need or want to run, it can cause unnecessary distractions, similar to the file addition issue.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Solution:\r\n\r\nExtend the blocking functionality to command suggestions with a new in-chat command called `/block-cmd`. This command would allow users to block specific commands (or command patterns) from being suggested by `aider`. This could be particularly useful when `aider` frequently suggests commands that are not relevant to the current task.\r\n\r\n#### Command Usage:\r\n\r\n- **/block-cmd [command_pattern]**: Blocks commands matching the specified pattern (supports regex) from being suggested during the session.\r\n- **/drop-cmd [command_pattern]**: Unblocks commands matching the specified pattern, allowing them to be suggested again.\r\n\r\n#### Example use case:\r\n\r\nLet's say you're working on an Infrastructure as Code repo. And you would prefer that Aider never suggest a command that would cause the changes to happen yet. Like a `pulumi up`. Obviously, in this case you should be taking other precautions as well but its nice to have a bit more help.\r\n\r\n### Version and model info\r\n\r\n_No response_",
