Now I'm a bit confused ;)\r\n\r\nWhen you say:\r\n\r\n> I am getting back the typename of the Items property instead of the value of the textblock text. \r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"I'm getting back\"? You mean the type name is assigned to `SelectedModule`? `SelectedModule` is a `string` so Avalonia is having to somehow convert `SubCommandModel` to a string, for which it uses `ToString()`. If you've not overridden `ToString`, then it will just return the name of the type, which is what you're seeing.\r\n\r\nAre you porting WPF code which uses `DisplayMemberName`? As you've seen we don't have this property in Avalonia, so a direct port isn't going to be possible. Or are you writing new code?\r\n\r\nCan you not just change `public string SelectedModule` to `public SubCommandModel SelectedModule` in your view model?"
