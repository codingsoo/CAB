        "body": "Hi,\n\nThis is about lazy load of EF. Alternative solutions:\n1. You can make GetLocationMappings method virtual, like:\n   <pre>public virtual GetLocationMappingsOutput GetLocationMappings(GetLocationMappingsInput aInput)</pre>\n   Thus, ABP can implement UOW for this method, and session will be usable in this method. If you did use this class over an interface, it was not needed.\n\nThis works but also implement 2nd solution:\n1. You can select LocationMappingTableModel included Countries. This is better than 1st solution (Actually, you should make it virtual anyway). Because, in first solution, EF will make a db query for each contry and this is a performance killer. This known as N+1 problem. When you Include Contries, it will execute just one query.\n   To implement it, You can add a method to your repository named GetAllListWithCountries() and in that like this:\n   <pre>return GetAll().Include(l => l.Country).ToList();</pre>\n\nIf you have added referenced to EntityFramework nuget package to your application layer and made GetLocationMappings virtual, then you can replace this line:\n\nList<LocationMappingTableModel> locationMappings = _LocationMappingRepository.GetAllList();\n\nwtih this one:\n\nList<LocationMappingTableModel> locationMappings = _LocationMappingRepository.GetAll().Include(l => l.Country).ToList();;\n\nThus, you don't need to create a new repository method.\n\n\n---\n\nI also have some advices:\n- EmEntityCommon and EmEntityBase classes should be abstract as I understand.\n- LocationMappingTableModel is not a good name. Why do you postfix with TableModel? If you want to implement DDD, your entities are Entity, not table model. LocationMapping is enough. If you really like, LocationMappingEntity is better. But if you dont want to implement DDD, it's OK.\n- Your GetLocationMappings method can be much more smaller if you map LocationMappingTableModel  to LocationMappingDto. AutoMapper can do nested mappings.\n"

        "body": "Hi,\n\nThanks for your time. And I will say it again. ABP is GREAT, Some questions:\n\nWhy do I need to make the following method virtual to make UOW work?\n\n``` c#\npublic virtual GetLocationMappingsOutput GetLocationMappings(GetLocationMappingsInput aInput)\n```\n\nHere is the relevant controller code:\n\n``` c#\n    public class LocationMappingsController : EmControllerGridView<GetNewLocationMappingOutput, GetLocationMappingOutput>\n    {\n        private readonly ILocationMappingAppService _LocationMappingAppService;\n\n        /// <summary>\n        ///     Class constructor\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <param name=\"aLocationMappingAppService\">Application service for locationMappings</param>\n        public LocationMappingsController(ILocationMappingAppService aLocationMappingAppService)\n        {\n            ViewBag.PageTitle = \"Location Mappings\";\n            _LocationMappingAppService = aLocationMappingAppService;\n        }\n\n /// <summary>\n        ///     Main view to display all the locationMappings in the system.\n        /// </summary>\n        /// <returns>Returns the view for all the locationMappings in the system.</returns>\n        [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)]\n        public ActionResult Index()\n        {\n            return View(RetrieveAllLocationMappings());\n        }\n```\n\nMy question is assuming I have interpreted the docs correctly this should not fail UOW? As you can see I did use the IRepository interface to call this method?\n\nI understand about using Include() to get the dependent entities. It was a mistake on my part that GetAllList() did that for included objects. Any chance you can add a call GetAllList(bool aWithInclude) where aWithInclude will do the necessary Include calls?\n\nI also appreciate your advice provided:\n- EmEntityCommon, EmEntityBase have been made abstract now. I was previously going to add some common functionality there but then decided against it and did not make them abstract agauin\n- Using TableModel as a suffix is an old habit. Changing to Entity would be better as I already have them descending from EmEntityBase\n- Yep understand about using AutoMapper for GetLocationMappings but as I was having issues with the Include() of Country I had taken it out for debugging.\n"

I did not understand it but I don't see all codes. What RetrieveAllLocationMappings() does?\n\nI'm considering to add an Inlcude method to repository but EF and NHibernate differently implements it. NHibernate does not support multiple include but EF supports it. If you will never change EF, than reference EF from application layer and use GetAll().Include(...). If you don't like it, you can extend IRepository for your project easily. Because I can not promise when I add it to ABP :)\n"

So, make your method virtual if you directly use the class. For interfaces, it's different. All methods of an interface can be proxied.\n"
