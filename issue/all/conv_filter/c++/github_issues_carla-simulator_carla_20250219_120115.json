Can someone help me in finding models for bike?\r\n\r\nNote: As it is easy enough to change the default vehicle by knowing the models and path, I think it would be good idea to have a text file with all the vehicle models available. It will make it easier for the documentation.\r\n\r\nPS: Please excuse me if this question is really basic or if there is already such file existing.

If this is true for your model you could either delete your simple collision and generate one manually yourself (Most efficient) or, in the details panel of the mesh, under collision, change collision complexity to \"Use Complex Collision as Simple\" this way it will use all the geometry of the model as collision (This option is a bit more costly but will probably work right away).

Those starts have to be placed manually on the map.\r\n- Without anything else added, the cars will drive around at 20km/h with the preference at intersections of going straight, otherwise turning left.\r\n- The SpeedLimiters can be used to easily change the speed the car is driving at (10km/h below the speedl limit)\r\n- For random routes around the map, an IntersectionEntrance is used on which the different turning options can be created. Every route consists of one or more Actors that are the waypoints on that route over the intersection.\r\n- Cars obey TrafficLights, but those lights need to be scripted to change color.\r\n\r\nIs this correct?\r\n\r\nSometimes I get \"Error: Controller doesn't have a roadmap!\" and one or more cars will not move around.
