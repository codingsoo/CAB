Install and setup for benchmarking.\n\n2. Run the benchmark to measure performance across the 133 exercises.\n\n3. Generate a summary report of how many of the exercises succeeded or failed.\n\n### Setup for benchmarking\n\nFirst, prepare all the groundwork for running the benchmarks.\nThese steps only need to be done once.\n\n```\n# Clone the aider repo\ngit clone git@github.com:paul-gauthier/aider.git\n\n# Create the scratch dir to hold benchmarking results inside the main aider dir:\ncd aider\nmkdir tmp.benchmarks\n\n# Clone the exercism repo\ngit clone git@github.com:exercism/python.git\n\n# Copy the practice exercises into the benchmark scratch dir\ncp -rp python/exercises/practice tmp.benchmarks/exercism-python\n\n# Build the docker container\n./benchmark/docker_build.sh\n```\n\n### Running the benchmark\n\nLaunch the docker container and run the benchmark inside it:\n\n```\n# Launch the docker container\n./benchmark/docker.sh\n\n# Inside the container, install aider as a development build.\n# This way you're running the code that you cloned above, including any local changes.\npip install -e .\n\n# Run the benchmark:\n./benchmark/benchmark.py a-helpful-name-for-this-run --model gpt-3.5-turbo --edit-format whole --threads 10\n```\n\nThe above will create a folder `tmp.benchmarks/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS--a-helpful-name-for-this-run` with benchmarking results.\nRun like this, the script will run all 133 exercises in a random order.\n\nYou can run `./benchmark/benchmark.py --help` for a list of all the arguments, but here are the most useful to keep in mind:\n\n- `--model` is the name of the model, same as you would pass directly to `aider`.\n- `--edit-format` is the name of the edit format, same as you would pass directly to `aider`. When working with an experimental LLM, I recommend starting with `whole`\n- `--threads` specifies how many exercises to benchmark in parallel. Start with a single thread if you are working out the kinks on your benchmarking setup or working with a new model, etc. Once you are getting reliable results, you can speed up the process by running with more threads. 10 works well against the OpenAI APIs.\n- `--num-tests` specifies how many of the 133 tests to run before stopping. This is another way to start gently as you debug your benchmarking setup.\n- `--keywords` filters the tests to run to only the ones whose name match the supplied argument (similar to `pytest -k xxxx`).\n\n### Generating a benchmark report\n\nYou can generate stats about any benchmark, including ones which are still running.\nYou don't need to run this inside the docker container, as it is just\ncollecting stats not executing unsafe python.\n\n```\n# Generate stats for a specific benchmarking directory\n./benchmark/benchmark.py --stats tmp.benchmarks/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS--a-helpful-name-for-this-run\n```\n\n## Limitations, notes\n\n- If you're experimenting with non-OpenAI models, the benchmarking harness may not provide enough switches/control to specify the integration to such models. You probably need to edit `benchmark.py` to instantiate `Coder()` appropriately. You can just hack this in or add new switches/config.\n- Benchmarking all 133 exercises against GPT-4 will cost about $10-20.\n- Benchmarking aider is intended for folks who are actively developing aider or doing experimental work adapting it for use with [new LLM models](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/issues/172).\n- These scripts are not intended for use by typical aider users.\n- Some of the tools are written as `bash` scripts, so it will be hard to use them on Windows.\n\n\n\n--- ./README.md ---\n\n# aider is AI pair programming in your terminal\n\nAider is a command line tool that lets you pair program with GPT-3.5/GPT-4,\nto edit code stored in your local git repository.\nAider will directly edit the code in your local source files,\nand [git commit the changes](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#how-does-aider-use-git)\nwith sensible commit messages.\nYou can start a new project or work with an existing git repo.\nAider is unique in that it lets you ask for changes to [pre-existing, larger codebases](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"assets/screencast.svg\" alt=\"aider screencast\">\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Tv2uQnR88V\">\n    <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-blue.svg\"/>\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n- [Getting started](#getting-started)\n- [Example chat transcripts](#example-chat-transcripts)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Tutorial videos](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html#tutorial-videos)\n- [In-chat commands](#in-chat-commands)\n- [Tips](#tips)\n- [Installation](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html)\n- [Voice-to-code](https://aider.chat/docs/voice.html)\n- [FAQ](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tv2uQnR88V)\n- [Blog](https://aider.chat/blog/)\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nSee the\n[installation instructions](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html)\nfor more details, but you can\nget started quickly like this:\n\n```\n$ pip install aider-chat\n$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-goes-here\n$ aider hello.js\n\nUsing git repo: .git\nAdded hello.js to the chat.\n\nhello.js> write a js script that prints hello world\n```\n\n## Example chat transcripts\n\nHere are some example transcripts that show how you can chat with `aider` to write and edit code with GPT-4.\n\n* [**Hello World Flask App**](https://aider.chat/examples/hello-world-flask.html): Start from scratch and have GPT create a simple Flask app with various endpoints, such as adding two numbers and calculating the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n* [**Javascript Game Modification**](https://aider.chat/examples/2048-game.html): Dive into an existing open-source repo, and get GPT's help to understand it and make modifications.\n\n* [**Complex Multi-file Change with Debugging**](https://aider.chat/examples/complex-change.html): GPT makes a complex code change that is coordinated across multiple source files, and resolves bugs by reviewing error output and doc snippets.\n\n* [**Create a Black Box Test Case**](https://aider.chat/examples/add-test.html): GPT creates a \"black box\" test case without access to the source of the method being tested, using only a\n[high level map of the repository based on tree-sitter](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html).\n\nYou can find more chat transcripts on the [examples page](https://aider.chat/examples/).\n\n## Features\n\n* Chat with GPT about your code by launching `aider` from the command line with set of source files to discuss and edit together. Aider lets GPT see and edit the content of those files.\n* GPT can write and edit code in most popular languages: python, javascript, typescript, php, html, css, etc.\n* Request new features, changes, improvements, or bug fixes to your code. Ask for new test cases, updated documentation or code refactors.\n* Aider will apply the edits suggested by GPT directly to your source files.\n* Aider will [automatically commit each changeset to your local git repo](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#how-does-aider-use-git) with a descriptive commit message. These frequent, automatic commits provide a safety net. It's easy to undo changes or use standard git workflows to manage longer sequences of changes.\n* You can use aider with multiple source files at once, so GPT can make coordinated code changes across all of them in a single changeset/commit.\n* Aider can [give *GPT-4* a map of your entire git repo](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html), which helps it understand and modify large codebases.\n* You can also edit files by hand using your editor while chatting with aider. Aider will notice these out-of-band edits and keep GPT up to date with the latest versions of your files. This lets you bounce back and forth between the aider chat and your editor, to collaboratively code with GPT.\n* If you are using gpt-4 through openai directly, you can add image files to your context which will automatically switch you to the gpt-4-vision-preview model\n\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the `aider` tool by executing the following command:\n\n```\naider <file1> <file2> ...\n```\n\nIf your pip install did not place the `aider` executable on your path, you can invoke aider like this:\n\n```\npython -m aider.main <file1> <file2>\n```\n\nReplace `<file1>`, `<file2>`, etc., with the paths to the source code files you want to work on.\nThese files will be \"added to the chat session\", so that GPT can see their contents and edit them according to your instructions.\n\nYou can also just launch `aider` anywhere in a git repo without naming\nfiles on the command line.  It will discover all the files in the\nrepo.  You can then add and remove individual files in the chat\nsession with the `/add` and `/drop` chat commands described below.\nIf you or GPT mention one of the repo's filenames in the conversation,\naider will ask if you'd like to add it to the chat.\n\nThink about the change you want to make and which files will need\nto be edited -- add those files to the chat.\nDon't add *all* the files in your repo to the chat.\nBe selective, and just add the files that GPT will need to edit.\nIf you add a bunch of unrelated files, GPT can get overwhelmed\nand confused (and it costs more tokens).\nAider will automatically\nshare snippets from other, related files with GPT so it can\n[understand the rest of your code base](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html).\n\nAider also has many\nadditional command-line options, environment variables or configuration file\nto set many options. See `aider --help` for details.\n\n\n## In-chat commands\n\nAider supports commands from within the chat, which all start with `/`. Here are some of the most useful in-chat commands:\n\n* `/add <file>`: Add matching files to the chat session.\n* `/drop <file>`: Remove matching files from the chat session.\n* `/undo`: Undo the last git commit if it was done by aider.\n* `/diff`: Display the diff of the last aider commit.\n* `/run <command>`: Run a shell command and optionally add the output to the chat.\n* `/voice`: Speak to aider to [request code changes with your voice](https://aider.chat/docs/voice.html).\n* `/help`: Show help about all commands.\n\nSee the [full command docs](https://aider.chat/docs/commands.html) for more information.\n\n\n## Tips\n\n* Think about which files need to be edited to make your change and add them to the chat.\nAider has some ability to help GPT figure out which files to edit all by itself, but the most effective approach is to explicitly add the needed files to the chat yourself.\n* Large changes are best performed as a sequence of thoughtful bite sized steps, where you plan out the approach and overall design. Walk GPT through changes like you might with a junior dev. Ask for a refactor to prepare, then ask for the actual change. Spend the time to ask for code quality/structure improvements.\n* Use Control-C to safely interrupt GPT if it isn't providing a useful response. The partial response remains in the conversation, so you can refer to it when you reply to GPT with more information or direction.\n* Use the `/run` command to run tests, linters, etc and show the output to GPT so it can fix any issues.\n* Use Meta-ENTER (Esc+ENTER in some environments) to enter multiline chat messages. Or enter `{` alone on the first line to start a multiline message and `}` alone on the last line to end it.\n* If your code is throwing an error, share the error output with GPT using `/run` or by pasting it into the chat. Let GPT figure out and fix the bug.\n* GPT knows about a lot of standard tools and libraries, but may get some of the fine details wrong about APIs and function arguments. You can paste doc snippets into the chat to resolve these issues.\n* GPT can only see the content of the files you specifically \"add to the chat\". Aider also sends GPT-4 a [map of your entire git repo](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html). So GPT may ask to see additional files if it feels that's needed for your requests.\n* I also shared some general [GPT coding tips on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36211879).\n\n\n## Installation\n\nSee the [installation instructions](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html).\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor more information, see the [FAQ](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html).\n\n## Kind words from users\n\n* *The best AI coding assistant so far.* -- [Matthew Berman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df8afeb1FY8)\n* *Hands down, this is the best AI coding assistant tool so far.* -- [IndyDevDan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPYFPvxfGZs)\n* *Aider ... has easily quadrupled my coding productivity.* -- [SOLAR_FIELDS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36212100)\n* *It's a cool workflow...

The user adds files either via the command line or the in-chat `/add` command. If GPT-4 asks to see specific files, `aider` asks the user for permission to add them to the chat. The transcripts contain notifications from `aider` whenever a file is added or dropped from the session.\n\n## Transcript formatting\n\n<div class=\"chat-transcript\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n> This is output from the aider tool.\n\n#### These are chat messages written by the user.\n\nChat responses from GPT-4 are in a blue font like this, and often include colorized \"edit blocks\" that specify edits to the code.\nHere's a sample edit block that switches from printing \"hello\" to \"goodbye\":\n\n```python\nhello.py\n<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"hello\")\n=======\nprint(\"goodbye\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED\n```\n\n</div>\n\n\n",
