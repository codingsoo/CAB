It has changed my view of LLM's and made me appreciate them so much more!\r\n\r\nI'd like to use aider from a folder other than my git repo.  `git` itself has an option for this: `-C`.  Does aider have any support for this.\r\n\r\nMy use case is that I'm using direnv from a directory that is not the root of my git repo.  I want to use aider from this dir, too.  I can't just put direnv at the root of my repo because I have multiple different configurations I use for various tasks with this repo.\r\n\r\nWith other tools, there is an environmental variable I can use.  For example, PIPENV_PIPFILE for pipenv and PYTHONPATH.  \n\n### Version and model info\n\nLatest version of aider",
