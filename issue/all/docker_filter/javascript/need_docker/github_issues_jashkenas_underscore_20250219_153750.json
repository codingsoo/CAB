That's not a good experience and seems to be common enough to warrant action.\n\nExtending DOM prototypes is a losing game too (see Prototype.js).\n\nUnderscore could detect DOM elements, avoid crawling, and do a strict equality check, `===`. This prevents the inconsistent behavior and browser freezes. Then Underscore could add support for a customizing callback to allow devs to tailor `_.isEqual` to their needs.\n\n``` js\nvar eq = _.partial(_.isEqual, _, _, function(value, other) {\n  if (_.isElement(value) && _.isElement(other) &&\n        value.nodeName.toLowerCase() == 'canvas' &&\n        other.nodeName.toLowerCase() == 'canvas'\n      ){\n    return value.toDataUrl() == other.toDataUrl();\n  }\n});\n```\n"
