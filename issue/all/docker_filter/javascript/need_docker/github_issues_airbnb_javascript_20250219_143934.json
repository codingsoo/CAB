    "body": "Hi,\r\nI am very new to Eslint but I would like to use your eslint configuration. Therefore I've created a new .eslintrc.json file in the root folder and put \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"airbnb\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\ninto it. Then I tried to install your config with `npm install --save eslint-config-airbnb` which threw some errors though:\r\n\r\n> +-- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY eslint@^3.19.0 || ^4.3.0                                                                                                                             \r\n> +-- eslint-config-airbnb@15.1.0                                                                                                                                                \r\n> | +-- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY eslint@^3.19.0 || ^4.3.0                                                                                                                           \r\n> | `-- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY eslint-plugin-import@^2.7.0                                                                                                                        \r\n> +-- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY eslint-plugin-import@^2.7.0                                                                                                                          \r\n> +-- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@^5.1.1                                                                                                                        \r\n> `-- UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY eslint-plugin-react@^7.1.0      \r\n\r\n                                                                                                                     \r\n                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n\r\n> npm WARN eslint-config-airbnb@15.1.0 requires a peer of eslint@^3.19.0 || ^4.3.0 but none was installed.                                                                       \r\n> npm WARN eslint-config-airbnb@15.1.0 requires a peer of eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@^5.1.1 but none was installed.                                                                  \r\n> npm WARN eslint-config-airbnb@15.1.0 requires a peer of eslint-plugin-import@^2.7.0 but none was installed.                                                                    \r\n> npm WARN eslint-config-airbnb@15.1.0 requires a peer of eslint-plugin-react@^7.1.0 but none was installed.                                                                     \r\n> npm WARN eslint-config-airbnb-base@11.3.1 requires a peer of eslint@^3.19.0 || ^4.3.0 but none was installed.                                                                  \r\n> npm WARN eslint-config-airbnb-base@11.3.1 requires a peer of eslint-plugin-import@^2.7.0 but none was installed.                                                               \r\n> npm WARN brawlstats.io@1.0.0 No description                                                                                                                                    \r\n> npm WARN brawlstats.io@1.0.0 No repository field.                                                                                                                              \r\n> PS C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\project-express> ^C^C                                                                                                                         \r\n> ESLint!\r\n> Ln 1, Col 1 (27 selected)Spaces: 2UTF-8CRLFJSON master* 0\u2193 2\u219100\r\n> Close\r\n\r\nVSCode shows:\r\n> InfoCannot find module 'eslint-config-airbnb' Referenced from: c:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\project-express\\.eslintrc.json\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?",

Separately, you can set `\"env\": { \"jquery\": true }` in your eslint config to enable jquery usage."
