Mongoose.Connect() failed:`, err);\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            console.log(`${logPrefix} Open(${env}). CONNECTED to MongoDB.`);\r\n        });\r\n        /// rest of code....\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if the new versions of mongoose has disabled this feature, or may be I am missing an extra options setting when connecting?
