    "body": "Hi,\n\nI love the idea, but I'm not sure how to get it to compile jsx for preact.\n\nThis is my gulp task:\n\n``` javascript\ngulp.task('scripts', function() {\n    var b = browserify({\n            \"entries\": ['app/js/app.js'],\n            transform: [babelify]\n        });\n\n    return b.bundle()\n        .pipe(source('app.min.js'))\n        .pipe(buffer())\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.init({loadMaps: true}))\n            .on('error', gutil.log)\n        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('../maps/js'))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/js'))\n        .pipe(notify(\"Built JS!\"));\n});\n```\n\nIf I added `reactify` to the transforms, it compiled, but transformed my code into `React.createElement`.\n\nI'm obviously way off course. What's the right way to do this?\n",

        "body": "Reactify doesn't seem to provide an option to set the JSX pragma. I would recommend using `babelify` to do your JSX transformation instead, since that's the officially supported method both for react and preact. For Babel 6, you need to install `babel-preset-react`, and then tell the JSX plugin to use `h` for JSX.\n\nExample `.babelrc`:\n\n``` js\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"react\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"transform-react-jsx\",{\"pragma\":\"h\"}]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nLet me know if that makes sense!\n"
