When I tried to change it manually on the AWS console, it was saying \r\n```\r\nIf the function uses a compiled language, or the function size exceeds the code editor storage limit (3 MB), you must upload a .zip file archive (or .jar file) when you change the architecture. Uploading a new .zip file package overwrites the existing code.\r\n```\r\n Is there any alternative way to override this? or how to change/migrate the processor without recreating/rebuilding the code?\r\n\r\n```\r\nprovider:\r\n  name: aws\r\n  runtime: nodejs12.x\r\n  timeout: 90\r\n  memorySize: 1024\r\n  tracing: ture\r\n  architecture: arm64\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI: if the code is less than 3MB and if it is not a zip file, I can change the processor using `sls deploy`\n\n### Service configuration (serverless.yml) content\n\n```yaml\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Command name and used flags\n\nN/A\n\n### Command output\n\n```shell\nserverless --deploy --stage flux\n```\n\n\n### Environment information\n\n```shell\nsh-4.2# serverless --version\r\nFramework Core: 2.18.0\r\nPlugin: 4.4.2\r\nSDK: 2.3.2\r\nComponents: 3.4.6\r\nsh-4.2#\n```\n",

Sigh, sorry.\r\nI'll close this report, but if there's any future change you'd consider to at least be more defensive over this (\"hey, you're an idiot like Rik who didn't indent properly, this isn't gonna work\") I'd +1 it.\r\n\r\nCheers."

It's even worse when you copy and paste code snippets from tutorials and stuff. Ran into this a couple of times \ud83d\ude2c...\r\n\r\nHelping here (showing better error messages) is on our radar!"
