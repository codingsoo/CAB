Even though the limit was increased, Serverless is still throwing the error in the title.\r\n\r\nObviously our limit is not 200 anymore but 500 instead and Serverless keeps telling that the It is still 200, why? \r\n\r\nHow can I use Serverless with more than 200 resources now that the limit has been increased?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

You needed to delete the service via `serverless remove`.\r\n\r\nYou might want to look for the deployment bucket,  which name would include `-serverlessdeploymentbucket-`. You could deploy again if you remove it once manually.\r\n\r\nP.S\r\nOne of the concepts of Serverless Framework is that it makes it possible to control any serverless services via only command line \ud83d\udc4d "
