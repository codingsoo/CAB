    "body": "Zooming a window which hasn't been raised will cause it to be occluded by other windows.\r\n(or more specifically all windows which have been raised since the window in question itself was raised)\r\n\r\nThis will frequently happen if you use `focus_follows_mouse = autofocus`. \r\nA common use case (at least for me) is to hover a window I want to fullscreen and then pressing the corresponding binding. \r\nAs it currently is I have to press the window before or after zooming it.\r\n\r\nA solution would be to force-raise any window which are zoomed.",
