  "body": "Recently started using goaccess for our apache base website. We are able to get console running and even was able to generate static HTML page. But again whenever I try to generate report in HTML either static or relatime it shows Websocket interface. Wereas would like to automate a process to generate real-time-html report which runs in background as a daemon or system service. Please can you guide. If this is answered already then please excuse me and share the link for me to refer.   ",

It provides fast and valuable HTTP statistics for system administrators that require a visual server report on the fly.\nMore info at: http://goaccess.prosoftcorp.com/ \n\n![GoAccess Main Dashboard](http://goaccess.prosoftcorp.com/images/goaccess_screenshot1M-03L.png?1373815595)\n\nFeatures\n----------\nGoAccess parses the specified web log file and outputs the data to the X terminal. Features include:\n\n* General Statistics, bandwidth etc.\n* Time taken to serve the request\n* Top Visitors\n* Requested files\n* Requested static files, images, swf, js, etc.\n* Referrers URLs\n* 404 or Not Found\n* Operating Systems\n* Browsers and Spiders\n* Hosts, Reverse DNS, IP Location\n* HTTP Status Codes\n* Referring Sites\n* Keyphrases\n* Support for IPv6\n* Different Color Schemes\n* Unlimited log file size\n* Custom log format\n* Output statistics to a file.\n\n### Nearly all web log formats... ###\nGoAccess allows any custom log format string. Predefined options include, but not limited to:\n\n* Common Log Format (CLF) Apache\n* Combined Log Format (XLF/ELF) Apache\n* W3C format (IIS).\n* Amazon CloudFront (Download Distribution).\n* Apache virtual hosts\n\nWhy GoAccess?\n-------------\nThe main idea behind GoAccess is being able to quickly analyze and view web server statistics in real time without having to generate an HTML report. Although it is possible to generate an HTML report, by default it outputs to a terminal.\n\nYou can see it more as a monitor command tool than anything else.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nGoAccess can be compiled and used on Linux, OSX, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD.\n\nBriefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install` should configure, build, and install GoAccess.\nAn INSTALL file is attached within the package for more-detailed instructions. \n\nhttp://goaccess.prosoftcorp.com/download#installation\n\nUsage\n-----\nThe simplest and fastest usage would be:\n\n    # goaccess -f access.log\n    \nThat will generate an interactive text-only output.\n\nTo generate an HTML report:\n\n    # goaccess -f access.log -a > report.html\n    \nTo generate full statistics we can run GoAccess as:\n\n    # goaccess -f access.log -a\n\nThe `-a` flag indicates that we want to process an agent-list for every host parsed. The `-c` flag will prompt the date and log format configuration window. Only when curses is initialized.\n\nNow if we want to add more flexibility to GoAccess, we can do a series of pipes. For instance:\n\nIf we would like to process all `access.log.*.gz` we can do:\n\n    # zcat access.log.*.gz | goaccess \n    OR\n    # zcat -f access.log* | goaccess\n    \nAnother useful pipe would be filtering dates out of the web log\n\nThe following will get all HTTP requests starting on 05/Dec/2010 until the end of the file.\n\n    # sed -n '/05\\/Dec\\/2010/,$ p' access.log | goaccess -a\n\nFor more examples, please check GoAccess' man page: \nhttp://goaccess.prosoftcorp.com/man\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n",
