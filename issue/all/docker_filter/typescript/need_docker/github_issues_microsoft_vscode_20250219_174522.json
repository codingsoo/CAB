This has the advantage of allowing me to use the mouse less for view adjustment.\n\nI've noticed that there is a difference between how this behaves in the full Visual Studio and in Code. In Visual Studio, when you use Ctrl-Up/Down and the view moves such that the cursor is at the limit of the screen, then the editor will advance the cursor such that it remains on the last line visible. Code, however, does not do this, so the next time you hit a key (e.g. a cursor key without pressing Ctrl) then the view resets back to the line you were originally on which is quite jarring.\n",

This is because the cursor stays put even when it completely scrolls out of view. Since this is all about keyboard navigation, then requiring the mouse seems counter to the spirit of it.\n\nMost editors have the cursor follow along at the top or bottom of the screen (depending on scroll direction) when scrolling beyond the current view. In that way, there's no jarring snap back to another location off-screen when you start moving the cursor with arrow keys again or start typing.\n\nHowever, some editors additionally allow you to hit ESC to snap back to the original position in the cases where you're scrolling just to take a peek instead of wanting to stay in the new location.\n\n\n---\n\n@alexandrudima I can understand this may not be a high priority item and hasn't been addressed yet, even though it's quite frustrating for some of us on a daily basis. However, would you mind explaining why you removed the bug label in light of my previous comment?\n"
