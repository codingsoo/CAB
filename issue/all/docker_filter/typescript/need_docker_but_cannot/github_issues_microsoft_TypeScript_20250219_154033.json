    "body": "this works in older versions.\n\nwhen I have the following code in 1.5beta:\n\n```\nimport refs = require(\"../refs\");\nvar xlib = refs.xlib;\n\nexport class PjscBe extends xlib.ClassBase{}\n```\n\nI get the following error:\n`265  Cannot find name 'xlib'.`\n\nthis issue goes away if I remove the extends.  I can use my external module in other ways just fine:\n`var log = new xlib.diagnostics.logging.Logger(__filename);`\n",

        "body": "Which older versions does it work in? Anyway, looks to me like the issue is that you're attempting to reference a variable (`xlib`) in a type name (`xlib.ClassBase`), which isn't possible. It should work if you change the declaration of `xlib` to be an `import`:\n\n``` typescript\nimport refs = require(\"../refs\");\nimport xlib = refs.xlib;\n\nexport class PjscBe extends xlib.ClassBase {}\n```\n\nThis will enable `xlib` to be used in both value and type positions.\n"
