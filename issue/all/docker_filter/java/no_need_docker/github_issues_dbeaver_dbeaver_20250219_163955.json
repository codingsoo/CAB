    "body": "It confused me when I ran two long queries in two tabs, to the same database.\r\nIt says it's running but then it appears that one waits for the other to finish first?  With no hint that that's the case.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIdeally both queries would run simultaneously.  If not then at least a different state like \"waiting for other query to finish\" would be nice to display in the UI.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSee above.\r\nThank you.",
