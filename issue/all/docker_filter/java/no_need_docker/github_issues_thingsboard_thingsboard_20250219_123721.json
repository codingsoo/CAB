I have some Devices with different Device Profile and some Dashboards to visualize Timeseries from these Devices. As Dashboard Datasource I have two Devices with different Timeseries. I'd like to use Image Map's Tooltip function with If statement. \r\n\r\nExample: I have Device1 with DeviceProfile1 and Device2 with DeviceProfile2. I like to visualize Device1's Timeseries if DeviceType == \"DeviceProfile1\".\r\n\r\nI'm using the following Tooltip script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar deviceType = dsData[dsIndex]['Type'];\r\nif (typeof deviceType !== undefined) {\r\nif (deviceType == \"DeviceProfile1\") {\r\nreturn '{energy:2} kWt';\r\n} \r\n\r\nelse if (deviceType == \"DeviceProfile2\") {\r\nreturn '{temperature:2} \u00b0C';\r\n}\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the same thing happens in all cases. If its manage to display the desired key, it will be displayed on all devices, not only on those for which the condition applies. If its failed to display the desired keys, then nothing is displayed in the text bubble. I'd like to get your help in this issue. If you need more information about the error, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n<!-- Add information about your environment and ThingsBoard version if applicable -->\r\n * OS:  Ubuntu 20.04\r\n * ThingsBoard: 3.4\r\n * Browser: Mozilla 102.0.1\r\n",

The closest I got was with this:\r\n```\r\n       var pl = self.ctx.pageLink(200, 0, '', null);\r\n       pl['sortOrder'] = {};\r\n       pl.sortOrder['direction'] = 'ASC';\r\n       pl.sortOrder['key'] = {};\r\n       pl.sortOrder.key['key'] = 'name';\r\n       pl.sortOrder.key['type'] = 'ENTITY_FIELD';\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich succeed to inject sortOrder in the request but not the sortProperty.\r\n\r\n/devices?pageSize=200&page=0&sortProperty=undefined&sortOrder=ASC&type=\r\n\r\nLogically resulting in a 500 server error with that error:\r\n\r\n`org.hibernate.QueryException: could not resolve property: undefined of: org.thingsboard.server.dao.model.sql.DeviceEntity [SELECT d FROM org.thingsboard.server.dao.model.sql.DeviceEntity d WHERE d.tenantId = :tenantId AND d.customerId = :customerId AND LOWER(d.searchText) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT(:searchText, '%')) order by d.undefined asc]; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: org.hibernate.QueryException: could not resolve property: undefined of: org.thingsboard.server.dao.model.sql.DeviceEntity [SELECT d FROM org.thingsboard.server.dao.model.sql.DeviceEntity d WHERE d.tenantId = :tenantId AND d.customerId = :customerId AND LOWER(d.searchText) LIKE LOWER(CONCAT(:searchText, '%')) order by d.undefined asc]`\r\n\r\nSo what is the proper way of performing this request with sort order on a field?",

Within this profile It\u00b4s possible to add Device groups and Dashboard Groups and configure them as puplic. When I switch back to the customer group admin account, booth Devices and Dasboards are sorted in the costumer group and are marked as puplic aswell. So Iam able to creat customer groups with puplic and non-puplic dashboards, which are not able to see devices and dashboards of other customergroups  within the same tenant.\r\n\r\nCheers"

At Dashboard Advanced Parameters tab, we have as default function the following. \r\n\r\nvar deviceType = dsData[dsIndex]['deviceType'];\r\nif (typeof deviceType !== undefined) {\r\n    if (deviceType == \"energy meter\") {\r\n        return '<span style=\"color:orange;\">${entityName}, ${energy:2} kWt</span>';\r\n    } else if (deviceType == \"thermometer\") {\r\n        return '<span style=\"color:blue;\">${entityName}, ${temperature:2} \u00b0C</span>';\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nSo, my doubts are:\r\n\r\n1) Which options are possible to read as dsData[dsIndex]? I mean, hoa can I get a list of possible keys?\r\n2) I tried to alter this function for assetType instead of deviceType, once my aliasses were created filtering my assets types, but it did not work. What I am trying to run is the following, but instead of create colors differenciation it is not returning any label for any asset. Without using label function the labels work fine (without any differenciation).\r\n\r\nvar assetType = dsData[dsIndex]['assetType'];\r\nif (typeof assetType !== undefined) {\r\n    if (assetType == \"ABC\") {\r\n        return '<span style=\"color:orange;\">${entityName}</span>';\r\n    } else if (assetType == \"DEF\") {\r\n        return '<span style=\"color:blue;\">${entityName}</span>';\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThanks for your help sharing your tips and comments.",

The short audio clips (<500KB) are base64 encoded and sent to TB as a JSON key/value. My goal is to provide access to the latest recordings on the dashboard so the user can quickly evaluate and take necessary action.\r\n\r\nSo I created a new widget to display the html5 audio element and set its src to the base64 encoded data string like this:`src=\"data:audio/wav;base64,UklGRgh3AQBXQVZFZm10IBAAAAAB \u2026 /6//q/+T/3P/g/9v/4//a/+j/3f/o/+X/6P/t//D/9v/3/w==\"`. However, Angular does not permit this because it is considered an unsafe url and disables it by prepending `unsafe` to the string like this: `src=\"unsafe:data:audio/wav;base64,UklGRgh3AQBXQVZFZm10IBAAAAAB \u2026 /6//q/+T/3P/g/9v/4//a/+j/3f/o/+X/6P/t//D/9v/3/w==\"`.\r\n\r\nThe obvious solution is to use Angular's DomSanitizer (`domSanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl()`) but it is not accessible within the widget's scope and it cannot be imported at runtime. A search of this repo shows numerous usages of the DomSanitizer, including in various widget components (ui-ngx/src/app/modules/home/components/widget/lib/alarms-table-widget.component.ts, ui-ngx/src/app/modules/home/components/widget/lib/entities-table-widget.component.ts, ui-ngx/src/app/modules/home/components/widget/lib/timeseries-table-widget.component.ts, etc.). \r\n\r\nIs it possible to access the DomSanitizer in a Widget? If so, how? If not, what other options can I try?\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n<!-- Add information about your environment and ThingsBoard version if applicable -->\r\n * OS:  AWS EC2 \r\n * ThingsBoard: PE 3.0.1\r\n * Browser: Chrome 84\r\n",
