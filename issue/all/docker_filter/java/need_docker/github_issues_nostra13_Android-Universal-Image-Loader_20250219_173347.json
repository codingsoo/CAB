    "body": "Currently the only way I have found to set an animation is to pass an anonymous class in on each `displayImage(...)` call (sample code in #35).\n\nIt would be great to be able to set a default `ImageLoadingListener`. Loading the animation on every `getView()` call is bad practice, the animation should be cached. This addition would make this much easier. You also wouldn't have to add an anonymous class to every `displayImage(...)` call in your app.\n",
