Unfortunately, the format of the text in those exports keeps changing, causing errors in my spreadsheet down the line. First, it was a bunch of extra header information at the bottom of the file for some reason, and now messages are exported with two carriage returns between each entry. Since my spreadsheet was setup to delete every third line to ready the data for processing, these rather massive format changes are casing significant problems for me.\r\n\r\nThank you for this awesome app.",
