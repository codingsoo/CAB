    "body": "Hi, I'm trying to deploy Orleans Silo to a Service Fabric cluster. I need my Orleans client to be outside of the SF cluster. With the sample code, the address saved in the Membership table is the internal SF ip.\r\nHow can I properly configure Orleans Silo to expose the external addresses for the client to use?\r\nOr maybe there is a way to use Static clustering to connect to the service fabric service?",
