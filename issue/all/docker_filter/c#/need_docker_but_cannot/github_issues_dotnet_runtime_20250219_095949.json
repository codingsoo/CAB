    "body": "I just tried some existing WPF code using .NET Core 3.0 preview 5 and VS 16.2 Preview 1. I read the porting guide for WPF and it seems to only talk about apps not libraries. The main changes seem to be \r\n```\r\n    <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>\r\n    <UseWPF>true</UseWPF>\r\n```\r\nWhen I try \r\n```\r\n    <OutputType>Library</OutputType>\r\n    <UseWPF>true</UseWPF>\r\n```\r\nI get unresolved references for all the WPF related stuff. I did try WinLibrary but that is rejected. Does this only work for applications at present?",
