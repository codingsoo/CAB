I'm using an Office 365 account. \r\n\r\nI've tried different ports, 25, 587, 465, set useSSL to false, true, SecureSocketOptions.StartTls, SecureSocketOptions.StartTlsWhenAvailable. But zero success.\r\n\r\n`client.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = (s, c, h, e) => true;\r\n client.Connect(\"mydomain.mail.protection.outlook.com\", 25, true);\r\nclient.Authenticate(\"username\", \"password\");\r\nclient.Send(message);\r\nclient.Disconnect(true);`\r\n\r\nI've also tried using `client.AuthenticationMechanisms.Remove (\"XOAUTH2\"); ` in the code but make no difference. \r\n\r\nThe error i'm getting is mainly \"The SMTP server does not support authentication\", but sometime \"The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format.\"\r\n\r\nI have an older web API project where i'm using the .net smtp to connect with above details with no issue. Is this an account setting thing or issue in my code???\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n  ",
