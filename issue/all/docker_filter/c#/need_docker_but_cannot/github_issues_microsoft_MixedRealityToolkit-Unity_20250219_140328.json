When I use the master branch with Unity 2017.1.1.f1 I'm stuck with\r\n ```Error! RenderTexture.GenerateMips failed: render texture does not have mip maps (set useMipMap to true).```\r\n that's freaking annoying because it floods my console a lot and could even lower performances.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with Unity 2017.2.0f1 (RC) and beta branch, I'm being told my target device ( Hololens isn't up to date) ` DEP3321: To deploy this application, your deployment target should be running Windows Universal Runtime version 10.0.16288.0 or higher. You currently are running version 10.0.14393.1715. Please update your OS, or change your deployment target to a device with the appropriate version.\tGTS_Demo`\r\nI'm already running Insider on it and it's up to date :(\r\n(Latest SDK and insider update installed on the dev computer)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finally, master branch MRTK with a beta Unity doesn't work, as I understand API changed a lot.\r\n\r\nI know this is not bug related but I'm starting to loose hope on finding a stable dev environment...  Plus Unity forums and  Microsoft Hololens forums never have shown very helpful\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance !",

On the unity build settings window, you probably have the build target set to \"latest installed\" where as HoloLens is at version 15063. If you set that to match, it should solve that problem."

Another common problem is when the wrong element has focus in the Editor (make sure that the 'Game view' has focus when saving.\r\n\r\nHere's the relevant excerpt from the SpatialMapping Readme:\r\nThe RemoteMapping scene uses the SpatialMapping and RemoteMapping prefabs to send spatial mapping data between the HoloLens and the app running in the Unity editor. To run this test, you must first open port 11000 on your firewall and then set the IPv4 address of your PC in the 'RemoteMeshTarget' and 'RemoteMeshSource' components. You can then build and deploy to the HoloLens. Once you see the wireframe mesh appear in your HoloLens, press the 'play' button in Unity to run the app in Editor. Ensure that the 'Game view' has focus, and then press the 'N' key (RemoteMappingKey) to switch to using the network as the spatial mapping source in the Editor. Once you are confident that you have a good mesh, say the 'Send Meshes' (SendMeshesKeyword) to send the meshes from the HoloLens to the Unity Editor. Press the 'S' key (SaveFileKey) to save the mesh to your PC. Press the 'play' button to stop the app from running in the Unity editor. Now, press 'play' one more time to restart the app. This time, press the 'L' key (LoadFileKey) to load the mesh that you previously saved into the Editor."
